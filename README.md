Guest Listing Program

This project is a simple console application that allows the user to enter guests for an event. The user can add guests to the list, and the process continues until the user types "yeterli" (which means "sufficient"). Once the list is complete, the program prints out all the guests.

Features

Continuously accepts input from the user.
Stops the listing process when the command "yeterli" is entered.
Prints all the entered guests to the console.
